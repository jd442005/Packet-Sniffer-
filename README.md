# Network Traffic Sniffer & Analyzer

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **network packet sniffer** that captures, analyzes, and visualizes real-time network traffic. It uses **Scapy** for packet sniffing and **Matplotlib** for data visualization. Captured data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

## 🔥 Features
✅ Real-time Packet Capture (Scapy)  
✅ Protocol Filtering (TCP, UDP, ICMP)  
✅ Traffic Data Logging (CSV format)  
✅ Data Visualization (Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol Distribution)  

## 🛠 Installation
### 1. Install Python Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install scapy matplotlib
```

### 2. Run the Script (Administrator Mode Required)
#### Windows:
Run Command Prompt as **Administrator** and execute:
```sh
python network_sniffer.py
```

#### Linux/macOS:
Use `sudo` to run the script:
```sh
sudo python3 network_sniffer.py
```

## 📂 Project Structure
```
📂 Network Sniffer Project
│-- network_sniffer.py  # Main script for real-time sniffing & analysis
│-- traffic_data.csv    # CSV file storing captured packets
│-- README.txt          # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Usage Instructions
1. Run the script and select a **protocol filter** (`TCP`, `UDP`, `ICMP`) or capture all traffic.
2. The tool captures **100 network packets**.
3. **Live packet details** are displayed in the terminal.
4. Captured data is **saved to `traffic_data.csv`**.
5. **Graphs are generated** to visualize network traffic.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Run the script as Administrator/root** to access network packets.
- **Install `Npcap` (Windows) or `tcpdump` (Linux/macOS)** if needed for packet capture.
- **Use responsibly** — Do not sniff unauthorized networks!

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Add **real-time alerts** for suspicious traffic.
- Implement **a GUI for better usability**.
- Improve **traffic filtering and logging**.
